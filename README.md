###  Hello! I'm Pedro Martínez González

Full-Stack Software Developer
I architect, build, and scale web and mobile applications from scratch to production, blending clean architecture with high-impact business outcomes. My work ranges from single-page applications and RESTful APIs to hardware-integrated solutions — always focused on reliability, performance, and maintainability.

Key Highlights

End-to-End Product Delivery – Shipped production-ready platforms from initial concept to deployment, ensuring code quality, scalability, and future-proof design.

Hardware-Integrated Solutions – Developed self-service kiosks with peripherals integration and queue-management systems, deployed on time and within budget.

High-Value Dashboards – Built real-time executive dashboards that cut manual reporting, enabling instant, data-driven decision-making.

Payment Systems Expertise – Integrated Dojo and Redsys APIs (terminals, web gateway, recurring payments) with full PCI-DSS/SCA compliance, tokenisation, and webhook orchestration.

Security & Architecture – Designed robust role-based permissions with Laravel Sanctum and custom policies, laying the foundation for microservices and single-sign-on.

DevOps & Automation – Established containerised CI/CD pipelines (Docker + GitHub Actions) to automate testing, enforce code-quality gates, and accelerate release cycles.
